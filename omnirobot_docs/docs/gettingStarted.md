# Getting Started

Below are instructions and suggestions for leveraging the OmniRobot ROS package.

For any issues, questions, suggestions, or failures, please contact us via the project slack channel.

## Prerequisites
### Software
* `Robotic Operating System (ROS)` - Basic understanding of ROS is necessary to work with this package.
* `Threads/processes` - Basic knowledge of tasks, threads, and processes is essential,
but not neccesary.
* `Ubuntu OS`: ROS and Arduino can be utilized on Windows/Mac, but a Linux distro is preferred. The following instructions will assume you have Ubuntu 16.04 on your desktop/laptop and Ubuntu Mate on your Pi.

### Hardware
The following materials will be necessary in assembling the OmniRobot:

* Jumper cables
* Power supply for the Arduino
* Power Supply for the Pi
* Jumper cables
* Wifi Router
* Computer with SSH access

## Installing
